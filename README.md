# Statistical-Analysis-in-Political-Science

These are investigations of the relationship between moral, political, and religious belief. 

## Leaving Religion

A critical replication and extension of an Djupe et. al.'s "Reconsidering the Role of Politics in Leaving Religion: The Importance of Affiliation," 
which is a study of the effect of political identity on, separately, religious identity and affiliation with a religious congregation. 

The replication data provided by the authors is hosted at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VWZZLO


## Moral Belief and Belief in God

This is an independent study using panel data. I theorize that participants in the panel whose moral evaluations weaken--that is, who come to see fewer issues 
as morally wrong or even morally relevant--will also experience a decrease in their subjective certainty about the existence of God, and vice versa. The results
are positive, but weaker than I expected. The main weakness of this investigation is weak data on morality. The data only contains two questions that are suitable
for measuring the "strength" of a participant's moral evaluations, and those questions are about abortion and genetic engineering, which are more politically
charged than I'd like the questions to be.

The data is the Portraits of American Life two-wave survey. It can be found here: https://www.thearda.com/data-archive?fid=PALS2PAN

An appendix contains an introduction to MLE, ologit, gologit, and MLE estimation of those models.

## Moral Foundations

This is a critical examination of Moral Foundations Theory. I give a theoretical argument against Moral Foundations Theory and investigate whether survey 
data supports that argument.

The data is the "Measuring Morality" dataset provided by the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University. The data can be found here: https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/attitudes/resources/measuring-morality/
