# Statistical-Analysis-in-Political-Science

These are investigations of the relationship between moral, political, and religious belief. 

## Leaving Religion

A critical replication and extension of an Djupe et. al.'s "Reconsidering the Role of Politics in Leaving Religion: The Importance of Affiliation," 
which is a study of the effect of political identity on, separately, religious identity and affiliation with a religious congregation. 

## Moral Belief and Belief in God

This is an independent study using panel data. I theorize that participants in the panel whose moral evaluations weaken--that is, who come to see fewer issues 
as morally wrong or even morally relevant--will also experience a decrease in their subjective certainty about the existence of God, and vice versa. The results
are positive, but weaker than I expected. The main weakness of this investigation is weak data on morality. PALS only contains two questions that are suitable
for measuring the "strength" of a participant's moral evaluations, and those questions are about abortion and genetic engineering, which are more politically
charged than I'd like the questions to be.

## Moral Foundations

This is a critical examination of Moral Foundations Theory. I give a theoretical argument against Moral Foundations Theory and investigate whether survey 
data supports that argument.
