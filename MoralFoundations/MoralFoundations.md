# Testing the Limits of Moral Foundations Theory

## Introduction

In “Mapping the Moral Domain,” Graham et al. find that moral judgments
can be grouped into five categories, or “moral foundations”: care,
fairness, loyalty, (respect for) authority, and purity. On the basis of
moral foundations theory, the authors predict that humans vary in the
moral judgments not just by being more or less moral, and not just by
being more or less concerned with individuals and more or less concerned
with community, but by being more or less concerned with each of five
different qualities that can be morally relevant. One of the payouts of
this theory is the possibility that two people, despite neither one
being more “moral” than the other, can have radically different
judgments not only about what is right and what is wrong but also about
what is and is not a moral question at all. Now, in its most consistent
form, this theory seems to me to be a theory about the form of morality,
as distinguished from the content of morality. That is, it does seem to
me to claim that those equally concerned with purity, for example, will
agree about all or even most questions of moral purity–they might
disagree on what is pure and what is impure. It seems to claim rather
that we can think of moral judgments and beliefs as originating from
five distinct “cognitive modules” or ways of thinking about what is
moral. Two people who disagree about what constitutes purity and
impurity nevertheless, according to this theory, are importantly akin to
each other, for whereas others might not place moral weight on purity,
these two do. To test this theory, the authors devised a 30 item survey
composed of five groups that each contain six items designed to reveal
the saliency of one of the moral foundations to the respondent. After
collecting more than 34,000 responses to this survey using a publicly
accessible website, the authors performed confirmatory factor analysis
with several models, one of which was the five-factor model predicted by
moral foundations theory. They found that the five-factor model fit the
data better than the other tested models and was a good fit by the
standard of conventional measures of goodness of fit for factor models.

In this short paper, I attempt to replicate, in a loose sense of the
term, Graham et al.’s findings. More precisely, I am interested here in
seeing whether the predictions of moral foundations theory find
confirmation using data from surveys that, one one hand, were not
specially designed by Graham et al. but, on the other, contain items
that can be intuitively grouped in accordance with the five proposed
moral foundations (proper replications of Graham et al.’s results have
been done. See eg. Davies 2014, Tamul 2020, and Yilmaz 2016). If the
predictions can find confirmation in this way, then the possibility that
the significance of the five foundations is contingent on the specific
items chosen in Graham et al.’s survey, which would mean that the five
foundations are not useful for understanding moral judgments as they
occur in the complexity of everyday life, will be diminished. First, I
compare the fit of the moral foundations model to data generated from a
second survey designed by some of the authors of “Mapping the Moral
Domain” to the fit of alternative models. Then, I do the same with data
generated from a collection of items I took from distinct questionnaires
that were all answered by respondents in one survey. Finally, on account
of the problems with the previous approach, I test the moral foundations
model on data generated from a questionnaire designed to measure the
moralization of everyday life situations. I find that 1) the moral
foundations model does reasonably well compared to other models in all
three cases and 2) the moral foundations model does not reach the level
of goodness of fit Graham et al. found it to reach in their article.

## Testing Moral Foundations on Friendly Scales

This part of the project is the closest to a proper replication of
Graham et al.’s results. Here I do confirmatory factor analysis on data
generated by a questionnaire designed for the purpose of measuring a
respondent’s moral foundations score by researchers who collaborated in
Graham et al.’s paper (Graham & Haidt 2012). If Graham et al.’s results
are robust, then a five-factor model that admits of correlation between
the factors should fit the data generated by this questionnaire well.

The Measuring Morality project, directed by Stephen Vaisey, collected
nationally representative survey data from 1519 participating adults.
The Measuring Morality survey combines 19 morality scales and measures
of other constructs that may be associated with morality. One of these
19 scales is the Moral Foundations Sacredness Scale (MFSS), which
measures the sacredness respondents assign to each of the five moral
foundations. The MFSS is divisible into six sets of three questions
(Graham & Haidt 2012). Each set of questions corresponds either to one
of the five moral foundations or to non-moral judgments. Each question
asks how much money the respondent would have to be offered in order to
do a specific action, with the stipulation that the actions will have no
lasting negative consequences for the respondent. The questions are thus
meant to force the respondent to abstract from prudential considerations
and judge the merits of the action by reference to itself alone. If the
respondents follow these instructions properly, then the amount of money
required by the participant to do the action should correspond to the
sacredness they assign to the moral principle the action violates.
Respondents have eight response options ranging from “\$0 (I’d do it for
free)” on the low end to “\$1 million dollars or more \[sic\]” and then
“never for any amount of money” on the high end. Responses between \$0
and \$1 million increase by factors of 10. Below are examples of actions
asked about in the items of each of the groups, along with their
corresponding moral foundations.

### Care

Stick a pin in the palm of a child you don’t know

### Fairness

Throw out a box of ballots, during an election, to help your favored
candidate win

### Authority

Make a disrespectful hand gesture to your boss, teacher, or professor

### Loyalty

Burn your country’s flag, in private

### Purity

Get a blood transfusion of one pint of disease-free, compatible blood
from a convicted child molester

### Non-Moral

“Sit in a bathtub of ice water for 10 minutes”

Again, since the questionnaire is designed to discriminate between the
five moral foundations (in addition to the non-moral), we expect that a
five-factor model, in which each factor is tied to the items relevant to
each foundation, should fit the data better than a model with fewer
factors and better than theoretically plausible alternatives. To test
this, I create seven models and compare their fits. Each model ignores
the non-moral questions and concerns only the moral items since Graham
et al.’s paper does not deal with non-moral survey items and does not
lay out a theoretical framework for understanding the relation between
non-moral questions such as these and questions that represent the moral
foundations. The fit comparisons of models of this sort are thus more
relevant to the replication of Graham et al.’s results. I include a
simple one-factor model, a two-factor model that ties care and fairness
together in one factor and authority, loyalty, and purity together in
another factor, a three-factor model that is the same as the previous
except in giving purity its own factor, a four-factor model that gives
every foundation its own factor except for authority and loyalty, a
five-factor model that gives every foundation its own factor, and,
finally, a second two-factor model and a second five-factor model the
details of which will be given below. The first four models are taken
from Graham et al.’s paper. The theoretical intuitions for these four
models are as follows:

### One-factor Model

Moral judgments and beliefs are dependent on a single unobserved
variable, namely a person’s morality, and any variations among what
people with similar levels of morality think is moral or immoral are
random.

### Two-Factor Model

Someone’s concern for the well-being of others (care) and fairness is
independent or relatively independent from their concern with social
hierarchies (authority), their group (loyalty), and bodily and spiritual
purity. We should expect this because concerns for care and fairness are
both concerns for the treatment of individuals whereas concerns for
authority, loyalty, and purity are concerns for the integrity of one’s
group.

### Three-Factor Model

The thought behind this model is the same as that behind the two-factor
model, with the difference that here the observation that purity is only
ambiguously tied to group integrity, on one hand, and often irrelevant
to the treatment of others (acts that are immoral on account of being
impure need not harm anyone other than the one committing them), on the
other, is taken to suggest that purity is independent or relatively
independent from the previous two groups of concerns.

### Four-Factor Model

The thought here is the same as the above except that the observations
that fairness and care often conflict (example: someone might steal
another’s gun when the other appears to be out of his mind) is taken to
suggest that concerns for fairness and care are independent or
relatively independent from each other.

The sixth model is suggested by exploratory factor analysis of the data.
The scree plot for the data without the non-moral items is shown below.
Although eyeballing the plot would suggest using only one factor, we
already have a one-factor model, and several of the significance metrics
included in the upper-right corner of the plot indicate two factors
should be used. The results of EFA with two factors, which are shown
below in Table 1, do not, suggest an intelligible grouping of the items.
The second factor loads highly onto two of the fairness items and all
the care items, which would be expected given the hypothesis that care
and fairness are foundations connected in being concerned with the
treatment of individuals. Moreover, the inclusion of the first authority
item and the second loyalty item could be explained by the fact that
those two items both concern one’s treatment of one’s family. One might
suppose that the two family-related items are inadvertently measuring
concern for the well-being of one’s loved ones or that they are
measuring a specific type of loyalty, familial loyalty, and that
familial loyalty, in distinction from other types of loyalty, flies
together with care and fairness. I cannot, however, see a plausible
explanation of the first fairness item having higher loadings under the
first factor than the second, and for that reason, the model I will test
when doing confirmatory analysis will include the first fairness item
along with the other fairness items in the second factor. I will discuss
the dangers of this sort of post hoc hypothesizing below. I am now
engaging in it only for the sake of curiosity.

The seventh model is suggested by EFA using five factors. Using five
factors is not warranted by the scree plot and the eigenvalue
significance metrics included in its upper-right corner, so I am doing
this only for curiosity’s sake. That curiosity is rewarded–the results
of the five-factor exploration, listed below in Table 2 (all EFA done in
this paper used MLE estimation and direct oblimin rotation, following
Graham et al. 2011), are quite interesting and suggest a grouping of the
survey items made on the basis not of moral foundations but of human
types or characters, which overlap the moral foundations. To help
indicate what I mean by this, I will list the actions asked about in
each item under the factor that loaded most highly onto them.

### Factor 1

F1: Cheat in a game of cards played for money with some people you don’t
know well F2: Throw out a box of ballots, during an election, to help
you favored candidate win F3: Sign a secret but binding pledge to only
hire people of your race in your company

### Factor 2

L1: Say something bad about your nation (which you don’t believe to be
true) while calling in, anonymously, to a talk-radio show in a foreign
nation L3: Burn your country’s flag, in private (nobody else sees you)
P1: Sign a piece of paper that says ‘I hereby sell my soul, after my
death, to whoever has this piece of paper’

### Factor 3

A2: Make a disrespectful hand gesture to your boss, teacher, or
professor A3: Throw a rotten tomato at a political leader you dislike
P2: Get a blood transfusion of one pint of disease-free, compatible
blood from a convicted child molester C2: Make cruel remarks to an
overweight person about his or her appearance

### Factor 4

L2: Break off all communications with your immediate and extended family
for 1 year -L3: Burn your country’s flag, in private (nobody else sees
you) A1: Curse your parents, to their face. (You can apologize and
explain one year later) P1: Sign a piece of paper that says ‘I hereby
sell my soul, after my death, to whoever has this piece of paper’

### Factor 5

C1: Kick a dog in the head, hard C3: Stick a pin into the palm of a
child you don’t know

Factor 1 loads highly onto the three fairness items, indicating that
concern for fairness is a relatively unified and independent quality.
Factor 2, however, does not load highly onto just one set of items. It
seems rather to be a combination of patriotism (loyalty particular to
one’s country, as opposed, for example, to one’s family) and religious
or spiritual concern. Interestingly, Factor 4 appears to be a
counterpart to Factor 2: the combination of loyalty to one’s family (and
not so much one’s country–this factor has a negative loading on burning
the flag) with religious or spiritual concern. If factor 2 is pious
patriotism, factor 4 is familial piety. Factor 5 is obviously that part
of care that concerns physical harm. Interestingly, factor 3 loads more
heavily on the care item that concerns verbal and emotional harm,
suggesting that the care foundation is actually divided between physical
and verbal or emotional harm. Moreover, factor 3 appears to represent a
concern for politeness that encompasses parts of the authority and care
foundations. I must, however, admit that I cannot account for why factor
3 might load highly onto the purity item concerning blood transfusions.
With that being said, however, these results from EFA with five factors
paint a fairly plausible alternate picture of the moral foundations.
They suggest that the moral foundations of Graham et al.’s research are
actually divided up among what I am tempted to call human moral types
that consist of clusters of different, and perhaps a priori independent,
moral beliefs and concerns.

Moving onto confirmatory factor analysis, I have listed the first set of
models, along with their fit statistics, in the figures below and Table
3 above.

As can be seen from Table 2, although the chi-squared of the models
tends to decrease as the factors increase and decreases noticeably in
the last model–although this is surely connected to the correspondingly
large decrease in degrees of freedom–none of the models is a good fit by
the metric of RMSEA. In the first place, no model’s 95% confidence
interval for RMSEA is below 0.06, a recommended cutoff for an acceptable
fit (Hu & Bentler 1999), and in the second place, the RMSEA confidence
intervals for each of the models overlap every other model’s, meaning
that there is not a statistically significant difference between them in
terms of RMSEA, at least by the 0.05 standard. The comparative fit index
(CFI) indicates that the alternative five-factor model is superior to
the rest, but once more, even this model does not achieve the
recommended cutoff of 0.95 (Hu & Bentler 1999).

We can then say the following. The alternative five-factor model might
be superior to the moral foundations five-factor model. If it is, the
implication would be that 1) individual “moral foundations” are not as
independent of one another as they theoretically seem to be, and
clusters of moral beliefs and concerns composed of aspects of those
foundations are in fact the true scales of an individual’s morality and
2) those clusters of moral beliefs and concerns that seem to straddle
theoretically distinct moral foundations might actually contain a hidden
theoretical unity that could be uncovered after further reflection. An
example of one possible theoretical unity is familial loyalty, which is
theoretically distinguishable from loyalty to one’s country or land.
These two types of loyalty may not be as connected as their common name
suggests. To speculate a bit, loyalty to one’s family could be supposed
on evolutionary grounds to be a “moral faculty” that developed prior to
the “moral faculty” for loyalty to a group of unrelated humans. It would
still, of course, be surprising if the latter “faculty” did not develop
on the foundation of the former given the apparent similarity between
the two loyalties as loyalties. Nevertheless, even this alternative
five-factor model does not meet conventional standards of good fit on
our data. Moreover, the fact that this model was devised using post hoc
reasoning from EFA results makes the question of its prior probability,
ie. its a priori plausibility, difficult to answer. For these two
reasons, its validity should be taken with a grain of salt. Finally, the
failure of the five-factor moral foundations model to attain
conventional levels of CFI or RMSEA for goodness of fit raises a
question about, but of course does not immediately invalidate, Graham et
al.’s findings.

## Testing Moral Foundations on Unfriendly Scales

As was stated above, the measuring morality survey contains 18 moral
questionnaires other than the MFSS. By assembling items from these 18
questionnaires, I created a Frankenstein’s monster of a moral
foundations survey. For each moral foundation, I chose the four items
from the 18 surveys that best represented it. I give examples below of
the questions I selected to represent the foundations.

### Care

How immoral is it to ignore a woman struggling to carry bags of
groceries?

### Fairness

How important is the value of being fair to others?

### Authority

How much do you agree with the statement “Obedience must be instilled in
children”?

### Loyalty

How much do you agree with the statement “The USA should cooperate with
other countries only when in its own interests”?

### Purity

How immoral is it to defecate, not wash one’s hands, and then prepare
dinner for oneself?

Since the questions come from different questionnaires with different
response scales, I normalized the variables for each item. I do CFA with
five models that correspond to the original five models tested above. I
do not include the alternative models tested above that were developed
from EFA. The reason for that is that EFA results indicate grouping of
the items according to the particular questionnaire they are taken from.
This issue plagues this series of tests, and as a result, these CFA
results must also be taken with a grain of salt. However, comparison of
the five-factor moral foundations model with the fewer factor models
should still be useful for evaluating the plausibility of the moral
foundations hypothesis. The CFA fit results, along with the model
diagrams, are given in Table 4 and in the diagrams below.

![Models](MoralFoundations_files/figure-gfm/Invented%20Questionnaire%20Models-1.png)![Models](MoralFoundations_files/figure-gfm/Invented%20Questionnaire%20Models-2.png)

As was the case above, no model reaches conventional standards for good
fit in the realm of either CFI or RMSEA. Unlike in the testing above,
however, the three-factor model with care and fairness distinguished,
the four-factor model, and the five-factor model are significantly
better than the models with fewer factors or with care and fairness
combined. This suggests that care and fairness have a decent claim to
being separated as factors when factors are forced to correspond to
moral foundations or groups of moral foundations. In the second place,
since the five-factor model is statistically better, according to RMSEA,
than the three-factor model with care and fairness distinguished, the
group of loyalty, purity, and authority likely has divisions within it,
as Graham et al. claim. Nevertheless, none of the models reach standard
levels for goodness of fit, so the validity of a foundations-based
factor model is questionable according to these results.

With that being said, however, the weakness of these results could be an
artifact of the phenomenon mentioned above, that items in this
artificial survey were heavily correlated with items that were taken
from the same questionnaire. The effect of this correlation on the
correlation matrix of the artificial survey dataset, and not the
weakness of moral foundations theory, could be the cause of the null
results. For this reason, I will do one final round of testing using a
non-constructed questionnaire from the measuring morality survey. Using
a non-constructed questionnaire should avoid the pitfalls of the
artificial questionnaire approach and, provided the non-constructed
questionnaire has questions that clearly correspond to moral
foundations, it should provide a good foreign testing ground for Graham
et al.’s model.

## The Moralization of Everyday Life Scale

The questionnaire I will use is the moralization of everyday life scale
(MELS). The MELS, which has 12 items, was included in full in the
measuring morality survey, and with the exceptions of two questions that
*might* fit the purity foundation but seem to be too remote from normal
morality to include, each of its questions corresponds more or less
clearly to a moral foundation. The text of the survey is given below.

### MELS Text

Below you’ll be presented with a variety of situations and be asked to
say whether certain behaviors in those situations would be morally
wrong. Please use the following scale from 1 to 7, to indicate the
degree to which you judge the behavior to be wrong (if at all).

1 = Not at all wrong; has nothing to do with morality. 7 = Very wrong;
an extremely immoral action

1.  Lying about a test score when reporting performance to a teacher.
2.  Faking an injury to collect on insurance.
3.  Parking in a handicapped parking spot when not handicapped.
4.  Using someone else’s toothbrush without his or her permission.
5.  Packing for a trip at the last minute.
6.  Choosing to wake up late, despite having a busy day ahead.
7.  Ignoring a woman struggling to carry bags of groceries.
8.  Ignoring a driver whose car is stuck in the snow.
9.  An 18-year-old girl breaking an abstinence vow to have premarital
    sex.
10. Drinking 10 beers at a party and vomiting several times.
11. Defecating, not washing one’s hands, and then preparing dinner for
    oneself.
12. Wearing a pair of pants for three weeks without washing them.

Again, although questions 5 and 6 might plausibly be said to reflect the
purity foundation of moral foundations theory, I judge them to be too
much of a stretch, especially when compared to the questions Graham et
al. use to estimate purity, and for that reason I will not include them.
Questions 1, 2, and 3 clearly measure fairness (in each case, someone
breaks a rule or lies in order to obtain an unfair advantage). Question
4 is somewhat ambiguous since it involves both illicit use of another’s
property and something (using another person’s toothbrush) that many
find to be disgusting. My judgment is that the latter factor is more
important for most people (a small-n survey of my three roommates
indicates that 100% of people feel this way), and for that reason, I
will include it in the purity category. Questions 7 and 8 clearly
correspond to the care foundation, and finally, questions 9 through 12
clearly correspond to the purity category.

Thus the ten questions can be broken up into groups that correspond to
three of the five moral foundations, care, fairness, and purity. The
results of Graham et al.’s paper suggest that we should expect to find a
three-factor model to fit these ten items much better than a one- or
two-factor model. To add a bit of excitement, I also perform EFA to
generate some ideas for alternative factor models. The relevant scree
plot is presented as figure 4. Since the non-graphical indices are
bivocal between using two and three factors, I perform EFA with both
numbers. The results are listed in Tables 5 and 6.

In the two factor results, factor one has significant loadings on the
care items and one of the purity items, and factor two has significant
loadings on the fairness items and three of the purity items. Since I
cannot discern a reason for the distinction between the purity items, I
will not use the results of the two factor EFA to construct an
alternative model. In the three-factor results, factor one has
significant loadings on the care items, factor two has significant
loadings on the purity items, and factor three has significant loadings
on the fairness items. The three-factor EFA thus suggests the model
Graham et al. would presumably support. For this reason, I will only
conduct CFA on a one-factor model, a two-factor model split between care
and fairness, on one hand, and purity, on the other, and a three-factor
model that separates care, fairness, and purity. The results of the CFA
can be seen in Table 7. Model diagrams for the three models can be seen
in figure 3.

Although even the best model does not attain the standard qualifications
for being a good fit, the three-factor model that accords with Graham et
al.’s paper is significantly better than the one and two-factor models.
This suggests that the care, fairness, and purity foundations are
reasonably independent from one another.

It remains the case, however, that the model suggested by Graham et
al.’s paper was not a good fit by the conventional standards in any of
the three tests. Judging by the relatively small communalities found in
the EFA results for the first and last sets of data, the reason may be
that the model, although it captures some of the structure of the
correlation of moral items, oversimplifies the relationships between
items found in different moral foundations groups. This might be
remediable by choosing items with a higher degree of specificity. For
example, the second loyalty item in the MFSS, “break off all
communications with your immediate and extended family for a year,” a
priori appears to concern care as well as loyalty, unlike the other two
loyalty items. On the other hand, moral foundations theory might be too
naive in supposing that care as such can be separated from loyalty as
such, for there is reason to believe that care and loyalty to one’s
family might be as closely related as loyalty to one’s family and
loyalty to one’s country. The way forward here seems to be to
a-theoretically gather moral questions from all walks of life and
cultures and then, using theory, to make predictions about the groupings
of those items. By using an extensive number of items, researches should
be able to find subgroups of the moral foundations, or new foundations
altogether, whose correlations could be examined in order to confirm or
modify Graham et al.’s model. For example, if the survey contained
enough items related to care, loyalty to family, and loyalty to country,
and if those respective items had high factor loadings on three distinct
factors, then the correlations between those three factors would
indicate whether loyalty to family and loyalty to country belong
together and justify the loyalty foundation or, on the contrary, loyalty
to family and care are more closely related and the loyalty foundation
is illusory.

y_{n1} & y_{n2} & \ldots & y_{np}
\end{bmatrix}")

where each row vector,
![\boldsymbol{y\_{i}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D "\boldsymbol{y_{i}}"),
is one of our observations. Our factor model will then be, for any
![\boldsymbol{y\_{i}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D "\boldsymbol{y_{i}}"),
the following:

![y\_{1}\*=\lambda\_{11}f\_{1} + \lambda\_{12}f\_{2} + \ldots + \lambda\_{1m}f\_{m} +\epsilon\_{1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_%7B1%7D%2A%3D%5Clambda_%7B11%7Df_%7B1%7D%20%2B%20%5Clambda_%7B12%7Df_%7B2%7D%20%2B%20%5Cldots%20%2B%20%5Clambda_%7B1m%7Df_%7Bm%7D%20%2B%5Cepsilon_%7B1%7D "y_{1}*=\lambda_{11}f_{1} + \lambda_{12}f_{2} + \ldots + \lambda_{1m}f_{m} +\epsilon_{1}")

![y\_{2}\*=\lambda\_{21}f\_{1} + \lambda\_{22}f\_{2} + \ldots + \lambda\_{2m}f\_{m} +\epsilon\_{2}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_%7B2%7D%2A%3D%5Clambda_%7B21%7Df_%7B1%7D%20%2B%20%5Clambda_%7B22%7Df_%7B2%7D%20%2B%20%5Cldots%20%2B%20%5Clambda_%7B2m%7Df_%7Bm%7D%20%2B%5Cepsilon_%7B2%7D "y_{2}*=\lambda_{21}f_{1} + \lambda_{22}f_{2} + \ldots + \lambda_{2m}f_{m} +\epsilon_{2}")

![\ldots](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cldots "\ldots")

![y\_{p}\*=\lambda\_{p1}f\_{1} + \lambda\_{p2}f\_{2} + \ldots + \lambda\_{pm}f\_{m} +\epsilon\_{p}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_%7Bp%7D%2A%3D%5Clambda_%7Bp1%7Df_%7B1%7D%20%2B%20%5Clambda_%7Bp2%7Df_%7B2%7D%20%2B%20%5Cldots%20%2B%20%5Clambda_%7Bpm%7Df_%7Bm%7D%20%2B%5Cepsilon_%7Bp%7D "y_{p}*=\lambda_{p1}f_{1} + \lambda_{p2}f_{2} + \ldots + \lambda_{pm}f_{m} +\epsilon_{p}")

where ![y\*](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%2A "y*") is the
demeaned value of ![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y "y"). We
call the
![\lambda](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda "\lambda")’s
the factor loadings, and we call the
![f](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f "f")’s the factors. We allow
each observation,
![\boldsymbol{y}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7By%7D "\boldsymbol{y}")
to have its own particular factor values, but we restrict the factor
loadings so that they are the same for all observations. Each individual
equation above thus expresses each variable as a linear combination of
factors, which can be thought of as latent variables. The primary goal
of factor analysis is to estimate the values of the loadings so as to
understand the effects of each factor on each of the variables.

We can write the series of equations above more succinctly in matrix
notation if we define
![\Lambda](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLambda "\Lambda") to
be

![\begin{bmatrix} 
\lambda\_{11} & \lambda\_{12} & \ldots & \lambda\_{1p} \\\\
\lambda\_{21} & \lambda\_{22} & \ldots & \lambda\_{2p}\\\\

\lambda\_{n1} & \lambda\_{n2} & \ldots & \lambda\_{np}

to be the demeaned observation (column) vector,
![\boldsymbol{f}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D "\boldsymbol{f}")
to be the column vector composed of the factors, and
![\boldsymbol{\epsilon}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D "\boldsymbol{\epsilon}")
to be the column vector of the error terms:

![\boldsymbol{y\*}=\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7By%2A%7D%3D%5CLambda%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%2B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D "\boldsymbol{y*}=\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon}")

## Estimation of the Loadings

We will limit our discussion of estimation here to the principle
component method of estimating factor loadings. To begin, we need to
enumerate the assumptions that make estimation possible:

![E(\boldsymbol{f})=\boldsymbol{0},](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E%28%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%3D%5Cboldsymbol%7B0%7D%2C "E(\boldsymbol{f})=\boldsymbol{0},")

![cov(\boldsymbol{f})=I,](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%3DI%2C "cov(\boldsymbol{f})=I,")

![E(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\boldsymbol{0},](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E%28%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%3D%5Cboldsymbol%7B0%7D%2C "E(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\boldsymbol{0},")

![cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\Psi,](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%3D%5CPsi%2C "cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\Psi,")

![=
\begin{bmatrix} 
\psi\_{1} & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\\\
0 & \psi\_{2} & \ldots & 0\\\\
\ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots\\\\
0 & 0 & \ldots & \psi\_{p}
\end{bmatrix}
,](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%3D%0A%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20%0A%5Cpsi_%7B1%7D%20%26%200%20%26%20%5Cldots%20%26%200%20%5C%5C%0A0%20%26%20%5Cpsi_%7B2%7D%20%26%20%5Cldots%20%26%200%5C%5C%0A%5Cldots%20%26%20%5Cldots%20%26%20%5Cldots%20%26%20%5Cldots%5C%5C%0A0%20%26%200%20%26%20%5Cldots%20%26%20%5Cpsi_%7Bp%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%0A%2C "=
\begin{bmatrix} 
\psi_{1} & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & \psi_{2} & \ldots & 0\\
\ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots\\
0 & 0 & \ldots & \psi_{p}
\end{bmatrix}
,")

and, finally,

![cov(\boldsymbol{f},\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\boldsymbol{0}.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%2C%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%3D%5Cboldsymbol%7B0%7D. "cov(\boldsymbol{f},\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\boldsymbol{0}.")

Since our model defines
![\boldsymbol{y\*}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7By%2A%7D "\boldsymbol{y*}")
in terms of our factors, loadings, and error terms, and since demeaning
our data does not change its variances and covariances, we can define
the covariance matrix of our sample in terms of those same factors,
loadings, and errors:

![\Sigma=cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CSigma%3Dcov%28%5CLambda%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%2B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29 "\Sigma=cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon})")

Since we have assumed that
![\boldsymbol{f}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D "\boldsymbol{f}")
and
![\boldsymbol{\epsilon}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D "\boldsymbol{\epsilon}")
are not correlated,

![cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}) + cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}).](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5CLambda%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%2B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%3Dcov%28%5CLambda%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%20%2B%20cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29. "cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}) + cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}).")

Since
![\Lambda](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLambda "\Lambda") is
not a variable, and since we have assumed that
![cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\Psi,](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%3D%5CPsi%2C "cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\Psi,")

![cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}) + cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\Lambda cov(\boldsymbol{f})\Lambda'+\Psi.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5CLambda%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%20%2B%20cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%3D%5CLambda%20cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%5CLambda%27%2B%5CPsi. "cov(\Lambda \boldsymbol{f}) + cov(\boldsymbol{\epsilon})=\Lambda cov(\boldsymbol{f})\Lambda'+\Psi.")

Finally, since
![cov(\boldsymbol{f})=I](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%3DI "cov(\boldsymbol{f})=I")
by assumption,

![\Lambda cov(\boldsymbol{f})\Lambda'+\Psi = \Lambda\Lambda'+\Psi = \Sigma.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLambda%20cov%28%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%29%5CLambda%27%2B%5CPsi%20%3D%20%5CLambda%5CLambda%27%2B%5CPsi%20%3D%20%5CSigma. "\Lambda cov(\boldsymbol{f})\Lambda'+\Psi = \Lambda\Lambda'+\Psi = \Sigma.")

Factor analysis thus aims to reproduce the covariance of the observed
variables with fewer free dimensions.

Since we are working with a sample of the population, we have access
only to the sample covariance matrix,
![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S"). We want, then, to
estimate our
![\Lambda](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLambda "\Lambda")
matrix (and ![\Psi](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPsi "\Psi"))
by solving

![S=\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda'}+\hat{\Psi}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%3D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%27%7D%2B%5Chat%7B%5CPsi%7D "S=\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda'}+\hat{\Psi}")

Following the principle component method, we initially ignore
![\hat{\Psi}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CPsi%7D "\hat{\Psi}")
and, as a result, are left with the relatively easy problem of finding a
pxm matrix
![\hat{\Lambda}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D "\hat{\Lambda}")
such that
![S=\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda'}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%3D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%27%7D "S=\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda'}").
As we will see, this does not mean that we are discarding
![\hat{\Psi}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CPsi%7D "\hat{\Psi}")
and consequently fitting a model with no
error–![\hat{\Psi}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CPsi%7D "\hat{\Psi}")
will return.

Since ![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S") is equal to
![Y\*'Y\*](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%2A%27Y%2A "Y*'Y*"),where
![Y\*](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y%2A "Y*") is the demeaned
sample matrix and assumed to be of full column rank,
![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S") is positive definite,
and since ![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S") is positive
definite, we can decompose it into a product of its modal matrix and its
eigenvalue matrix. That is, if
![M](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M "M") is the modal matrix of
![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S"), and if
![L](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L "L") is the matrix whose
diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of the column vectors
of![M](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M "M") with respect to
![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S"), then

![SM=ML](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SM%3DML "SM=ML")

![SMM'=MLM'](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?SMM%27%3DMLM%27 "SMM'=MLM'")

, and because modal matrices are orthogonal matrices,

![S=MLM'](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%3DMLM%27 "S=MLM'")

![=ML^{\frac{1}{2}}L^{\frac{1}{2}}M'](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%3DML%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7DL%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7DM%27 "=ML^{\frac{1}{2}}L^{\frac{1}{2}}M'")

![=(ML^{\frac{1}{2}})(ML^{\frac{1}{2}})'](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%3D%28ML%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%29%28ML%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%29%27 "=(ML^{\frac{1}{2}})(ML^{\frac{1}{2}})'")

Tempting as it may be to identify
![\hat{\Lambda}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D "\hat{\Lambda}")
with
![ML^{\frac{1}{2}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ML%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D "ML^{\frac{1}{2}}"),
we cannot yet do so since
![ML^{\frac{1}{2}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ML%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D "ML^{\frac{1}{2}}")
is a
![p \times p](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20%5Ctimes%20p "p \times p")
matrix whereas
![\hat{\Lambda}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D "\hat{\Lambda}")
is, by assumption, a
![p \times m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20%5Ctimes%20m "p \times m")
matrix with
![m \< p](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%3C%20p "m < p").
Were we to identify
![\hat{\Lambda}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D "\hat{\Lambda}")
with
![ML^{\frac{1}{2}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ML%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D "ML^{\frac{1}{2}}"),
we would both lose the power of the factor model, which is to reduce the
effective dimensionality of the covariance of our sample, and be
ignoring our model’s error terms. Hence we instead define
![\hat{\Lambda}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D "\hat{\Lambda}")
to be
![M^{\*}L^{\*\frac{1}{2}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M%5E%7B%2A%7DL%5E%7B%2A%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D "M^{*}L^{*\frac{1}{2}}"),
where
![L^{\*}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L%5E%7B%2A%7D "L^{*}") is
the
![m \times m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Ctimes%20m "m \times m")
matrix formed by removing the right
![p-m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p-m "p-m") columns and the
bottom ![p-m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p-m "p-m") rows of
the ![L](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L "L") matrix, and hence
has as its diagonals the
![m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m "m") greatest eigenvalues,
and
![M^{\*}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M%5E%7B%2A%7D "M^{*}") is
the
![p \times m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20%5Ctimes%20m "p \times m")
matrix formed by removing the right
![p-m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p-m "p-m") columns of
![M](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?M "M") and hence is composed
of the ![m](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m "m") eigenvectors of
![S](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S "S") with the largest
eigenvalues. Now that we have
![\hat{\Lambda}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D "\hat{\Lambda}"),
we can estimate
![\Psi](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CPsi "\Psi") as

![\hat{\Psi}=S-\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda}'](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5CPsi%7D%3DS-%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D%27 "\hat{\Psi}=S-\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda}'")

since, as we saw earlier,

![S=\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda'}+\hat{\Psi}.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%3D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%7D%5Chat%7B%5CLambda%27%7D%2B%5Chat%7B%5CPsi%7D. "S=\hat{\Lambda}\hat{\Lambda'}+\hat{\Psi}.")

## Rotation

Let ![T](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T "T") be an orthogonal
matrix. Since
![TT'=I](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?TT%27%3DI "TT'=I"),

![\boldsymbol{y\*}=\Lambda TT' \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon},](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboldsymbol%7By%2A%7D%3D%5CLambda%20TT%27%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D%2B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%2C "\boldsymbol{y*}=\Lambda TT' \boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon},")

![=\Lambda\_{\*} \boldsymbol{f\_{\*}}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon},](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%3D%5CLambda_%7B%2A%7D%20%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf_%7B%2A%7D%7D%2B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%2C "=\Lambda_{*} \boldsymbol{f_{*}}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon},")

where
![\Lambda\_{\*}=\Lambda T,](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLambda_%7B%2A%7D%3D%5CLambda%20T%2C "\Lambda_{*}=\Lambda T,")
and
![f\_{\*}=T'\boldsymbol{f}.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f_%7B%2A%7D%3DT%27%5Cboldsymbol%7Bf%7D. "f_{*}=T'\boldsymbol{f}.")
Similarly,

![S=\Lambda\_{\*}\Lambda\_{\*}' +\Psi](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S%3D%5CLambda_%7B%2A%7D%5CLambda_%7B%2A%7D%27%20%2B%5CPsi "S=\Lambda_{*}\Lambda_{*}' +\Psi")

since

![\Lambda\_{\*}\Lambda\_{\*}'=\Lambda TT'\Lambda'=\Lambda I \Lambda'=\Lambda \Lambda'.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLambda_%7B%2A%7D%5CLambda_%7B%2A%7D%27%3D%5CLambda%20TT%27%5CLambda%27%3D%5CLambda%20I%20%5CLambda%27%3D%5CLambda%20%5CLambda%27. "\Lambda_{*}\Lambda_{*}'=\Lambda TT'\Lambda'=\Lambda I \Lambda'=\Lambda \Lambda'.")

We can take advantage of this property of the factor model to rotate our
loadings so as to aid in interpreting our factors. We interpret our
factors by observing which variables they have high loadings on and
which variables they have low loadings on. If a factor has high loadings
on three variables that measure, say, vocabulary, reading comprehension,
and analogical reasoning, and another factor has high loadings on three
variables that measure running speed, jumping distance, and maximal
squat weight, then we would interpret the first factor to be a latent
verbal ability variable and the second to be a latent lower body fitness
variable. Rotating our factor loadings so as to concentrate the loadings
of one factor on certain variables, the loadings of another factor on
certain other variables, etc. allows us to interpret the
representational significance of the factors.

Oblique rotations are non-orthogonal transformations of the factors with
a matrix ![T](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T "T") such that
![TT' \ne I.](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?TT%27%20%5Cne%20I. "TT' \ne I.")
The covariance matrix of
![f\*](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f%2A "f*") will now not be
equal to ![I](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I "I") since

![cov(Tf)=Tcov(f)T'=TT'\ne I](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?cov%28Tf%29%3DTcov%28f%29T%27%3DTT%27%5Cne%20I "cov(Tf)=Tcov(f)T'=TT'\ne I")

Hence factors will be correlated after an oblique transformation is
applied. For factors that are not truly orthogonal but have small enough
correlations to potentially be representing separate latent variables,
oblique transformations can be used to consolidate loadings and ease
interpretation.
