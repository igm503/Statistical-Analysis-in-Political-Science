All data analyses in this article were carried out using Stata 14MP for Windows (64-bit). 

This replication file contains five datasets, 7 codebooks, and 5 Stata do files organized in folders for each dataset.

The first dataset (2006_panel.dta) contains the data sufficient to replicate Table 1 (portion), Table 3, Figure 2, Table A1, Table A2, and Table A3 (all tables and figures with the “A” prefix are in the SI file). The code to do so is contained in “2006_do.do.” This two-wave panel was gathered from a random sample of Franklin County Republican voters in the 2006 gubernatorial primary, who we followed into the general election six months later. This was funded by a small grant to Paul Djupe from the Denison University Research Foundation.

The second dataset (2012_merged.dta) contains the data sufficient to replicate Table 1 (portion), Table 2, Figure 1, Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A9, Figure A10, and Figure A11 (code in “2012_do.do”). This is part of a two wave panel study of American adults surveyed through the Qualtrics Panel in September and November 2012. This was funded by a NSF dissertation improvement grant to Anand Sokhey.

The third dataset (ANES_cumulative.dta) contains the data sufficient to replicate Figures A6-A8 and Tables A8-A9 in the SI. The code is in “ANES_cumulative.do”.

The fourth dataset (PALS_merge.dta) contains the data to replicate Figure 3, Table A4, Table A5, Figure A12, and Table A10. The code is in “PALS_do.do”. PALS (Portraits of American Life) is a two wave panel of American adults beginning in 2006 with followup in 2012.

The fifth dataset is assembled using “USCLS_do.do” from a “random attender” file and a “profile” file – instructions are in the “USCLS_do.do” file. The code will then replicate Figure A3, Table A7, Figure A4, and Figure A5, all of which are in the SI.
